Below you will find links to some of my personal projects
both interesting and ancient.  Unfortunately I am unable to
upload most school projects due to plagiarism concerns,
if you are an employer looking to see more of my work
please email me.

## Current Projects

### Kenwood TS-850s Restoration
I'm restoring my Kenwood TS-850s, I'll make periodic posts about it on my [Amateur Radio Twitter @N7AJ_](https://twitter.com/N7AJ)

## Back Burner Projects

### Baseball-Pi - [Github](https://github.com/Goldman60/baseball-pi)

A baseball scoreboard using off the shelf hardware
attached to a raspberry pi.
Temporarily on hiatus while MLB is closed due to COVID-19.  I'd like to pick this
back up after the quarantine is over.

### Remote Telemetry Station

A multipurpose remote telemetry station running on the Texas
Instruments MSP432 microcontroller and CC1101 integrated radio IC.
Created initially for CPE329 in 4 weeks it includes a PCB with hand placed
surface mount components and complete software.  This project is currently
on the back burner.

## Completed Projects

### Solar Irradiance Microforecasting

My senior project.  We were provided a 360 degree dome IR camera by
the University of New Mexico.  This camera could be utilized to take
pictures of clouds allowing for data driven near term cloud forecasts
for small solar installations to reduce battery wear and operation costs.

My portion of the project consisted of collecting a significant amount of
data and writing a Python GUI for future EE and CPE students at Cal Poly
to hack and expand.  The Python GUI source is available under the MIT
license [here](https://git.nclf.net/SIMF/simf-python-gui).

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions via my contact details in
the website footer.

### Tractor Hacking - [Website](https://tractorhacking.github.io)

My Cal Poly CPE350/CPE450 Capstone project to reverse
engineer a John Deere Tractor ECU.

### Space Race - [Website](https://projects.ajfite.com/csc471-finalproject)

My C++/OpenGL project for CSC 471.  Not exactly the outcome I wanted but
getting time crunched by graduation and Senior Project, it didn't turn
out too bad.

## Ancient Projects

These projects are archives of extremely old work, kept around for fun
and nostalgia only.  They are not representative of my present skills,
but I like to keep them around.
