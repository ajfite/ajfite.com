The code is far enough along now that I can begin testing the scoreboard's first iteration.
At the moment it dynamically grabs the teams that are playing, inning scores, hits, balls, and errors.

Hopefully the 6:10pm game against the Padres verifies that the scoreboard can run a full game without
crashing but we'll see.

The test is in progress as of just a few minutes ago, GO MARINERS!
