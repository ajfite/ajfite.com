This is a work in progress, pictures coming at some point!

## Archive

This IBM PC was likely a former machine used by Marist College, possibly in a computer lab or library.  I've reached out to the Marist Archives and will be sending them the file archive for their perusal.

## Repair

Shockingly the Hard Drive was still running and the machine booted right up into IBM PC-DOS 2.0.

## Modernization

In order to fit the machine into a modern workflow I've swapped out the MFM hard drive for an [XT-IDE Rev 4](https://users.glitchwrks.com/~glitch/2017/11/23/xt-ide-rev4) and swapped in a half height 5 1/4 inch drive so that the other half of the bay can be used by an [OLED GoTek](https://www.gotekemulator.com/P_view.asp?pid=75).
