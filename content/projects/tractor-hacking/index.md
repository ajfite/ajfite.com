My Cal Poly CPE350/CPE450 Capstone project to begin the process of reverse engineer a John Deere Tractor's CAN bus allowing future teams to devise ways to enable farmers to do work on their own tractors.

For posterity the website as it was when I left the project is [preserved here](https://tractorhacking.projects.ajfite.com).  For all other inquiries I reccomend you reach out to the new maintainers at the [live website](https://tractorhacking.github.io)!
