title: Big site update!
categories: website

I just went through and overhauled most of the site content.  I'm going
to take a stab at rethemeing the site in the near future as its currently
quite ugly.  Hopefully going to add some of my ham radio stuff on here
as well, that would make the site a lot more lively.

Once my job starts at Boeing I look forward to having more spare cash
and less evening work than college to pursue some of my back burner projects
and blog more about my software and hardware exploits.

Signing off
