# Projects On Hold

These are projects that I am not currently working on and have no solid plans to work on but I could see myself returning to them in the future.

## Remote Telemetry Station

A multipurpose remote telemetry station running on the Texas Instruments MSP432 microcontroller and CC1101 integrated radio IC. Created initially for CPE329 in 4 weeks it includes a PCB with hand placed surface mount components and complete software. This project is currently on the back burner.

# Defunct Projects

These are projects that are higher quality than my ancient projects but I have no interest in continued maintenance.  They exist as an archive and may or may not represent my current skills.

## [Cal Poly CSC471 "Space Race"](https://projects.ajfite.com/csc471-finalproject/)

My C++/OpenGL project for CSC 471. Not exactly the outcome I wanted but getting time crunched by graduation and Senior Project, it didnâ€™t turn out too bad.

# Ancient Projects

These projects are archives of extremely old work, kept around for fun and nostalgia only. They are not representative of my present skills, but I like to keep them around.  I may occasionally do
maintenance on the web based projects to preserve them as browser technology evolves, for example
eliminating the need for Flash from my National History Day project.
