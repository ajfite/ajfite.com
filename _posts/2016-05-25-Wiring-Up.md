title: Wiring the pi
---
The baseball-pi program is designed to display the score on a set of dedicated hardware.  I didn't
want to just use a standard screen because at that point I might as well just run a web browser
with MLB Gameday open on it, and that's no fun.

For my main scoreboard display I used an [HD44780](/assets/pdfs/HD44780.pdf) based 4x20 character display.  The screen is in
4-bit mode and uses 6 GPIO pins to operate.  This makes my wiring relatively simple:

At this point my code is just far along enough to get the screen to display static images so I've
mocked up how I want the main scoreboard screen to look:

And a wide shot:

That's all for now.
