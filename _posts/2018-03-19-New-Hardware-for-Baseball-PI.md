A new hardware list has been assembled for the new Baseball-Pi, right now its
up as a [public wishlist on adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/459586).

The new Baseball-PI will still be written in C++ but I'm exploring simpler
XML libraries to use in place of libxml++/libxml2.  I'll be changing the structure
of the project a bit to make my use of the MLB Gameday XML API more useful to other
developers.
