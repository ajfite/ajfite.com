Mariners Baseball is back for 2018, before the team goes down in flames
I want to exploit the general feelings of "good" into renewed progress
on Baseball-PI.

## What is Changing, What is New?

The original project was written in C++, I want to continue work with this
language.  It was also written for a Raspberry Pi 3, I will be transitioning
to a Raspberry Pi Zero W, its lower cost and smaller allowing me to package
the project in the future.

Hopefully most of the code will be easily ported, and what isn't can be replaced.

## Why the renewed interest?

I will hopefully be employed and want a nice home project for the summer!

New hardware orders will hopefully go out during early march and I can hit the
ground running on opening day at the end of March.
