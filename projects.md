Below you will find links to some of my personal projects
both interesting and ancient.  Unfortunately I am unable to
upload school projects due to plagiarism concerns,
if you are an employer looking to see more of my work
please email me.

## Current Projects

### Baseball-Pi - [Github](https://github.com/Goldman60/baseball-pi)

A baseball scoreboard using off the shelf hardware
attached to a raspberry pi.
Temporarily on hiatus while I rework the project
and wait for a new Mariners season.

### Tractor Hacking - [Website](https://tractorhacking.github.io)

An ongoing Cal Poly CPE350/CPE450 Capstone project to reverse
engineer a John Deere Tractor ECU.

### Remote Telemetry Station

A multipurpose remote telemetry station running on the Texas
Instruments MSP432 microcontroller and CC1101 integrated radio IC. 
A work in progress, more information to come.

## Old Projects

These projects are archives of extremely old work, kept around for fun
and nostalgia only.  They are not representative of my present skills,
but still fun to see.
